    "### Key Idea\n",
    "In contrasting iteration and recursion, we must be careful not to confuse the notion of a recursive process with the notion of a recursive procedure. When we describe the procedure as recurisve, we are referring to the syntactic fact that the procedure definition refers to the procedure itself. But when we describe a process as following a pattern that is, say, linearly recursive, we are speaking about how the process evolves, not about the syntax of how a procedure is written. It may seem disturbing that we refer a recursive procedure such as `fact-iter` as generating an iterative process. However the process really is iterative: Its state is captured completely by its three state variables, and an interpreter need keep track of only three variables in order to execute the process.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* If `a` is exactly 0, we should count that as 1 way to make change\n",
    "* If `a` is less than 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change\n",
